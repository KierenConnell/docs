# Vaults

## Introduction

Vaults are the central pieces of Monica. They contain your private data–contacts, documents, photos. You can't store something in Monica if not in a vault.

Vaults are private by nature.

Inside the same account, users who not part of a vault can't see the content of a vault, even if they are administrators of the account.

Creating a vault is the first step every new user of Monica should do–as otherwise, there is nothing else to do in the account.

## Vault visibility & permissions

### General information

A vault can have one or more users. Those users must be in the same account.

If you are not part of the vault, you can’t access it – and you can’t even see the vault on your dashboard.

Even if you are the account administrator, you won’t be able to access a vault if you are not part of the vault. You won’t see the vault on your dashboard as well.
