# Manage currencies

There are several parts in Monica where you can indicate a currency (loans, for instance). There are [many, many currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_circulating_currencies) in the world â€“ 130 in fact. There are very good chances that you don't need all those currencies, even though Monica supports them all.

In your `Settings > Personalize your account > Currencies` page, you can enable or disable the currencies you want to use in your account. Every user in the account will inherit those settings.

You can also disable them all, or enable them all. It's up to you.
