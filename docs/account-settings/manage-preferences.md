# Manage preferences

In the Settings section, every user in the account can customize his/her account in order to match their taste. This happens under `Settings > User preferences`.


:::info

Every settings under this section are defined per user, and won't affect other users of the same account.

## Timezone

Not everyone lives in the UTC timezone. Monica's users come from all over the place. Therefore, we need to let users manage their timezones. By default, UTC is the timezone for all users.

Changing timezone will affect all the dates that are displayed in the application.
