# Manage preferences

In the Settings section, every user in the account can customize his/her account in order to match their taste. This happens under `Settings > User preferences`.


:::info

Every settings under this section are defined per user, and won't affect other users of the same account.

## Language

Monica is translated into different languages. You can change the language whenever you want, and the change will be effective immediately.

:::info

Sometimes you will notice that some words in the application are not transalted 

:::

## Timezone

Not everyone lives in the UTC timezone. Monica's users come from all over the world. Therefore, we need to let users manage their timezones. By default, UTC is the timezone for all users.

Changing timezone will affect all the dates that are displayed in the application, and will dictate at which time of the day we should send you the different reminders that you might define in your account.
