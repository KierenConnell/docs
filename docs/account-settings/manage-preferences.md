# Manage preferences

In the Settings section, every user in the account can customize his/her account in order to match his/her taste. This happens under `Settings > User preferences`.


:::info

Each setting under this section are defined per user, and won't affect other users of the same account.

## Help display

While we hope Monica is easy to use and doesn't need any explanation, there might be some time where you will want to have more information about a feature. This is exactly the reason we have this documentation portal.

We've tried to write some help documentation for every feature. Next to each feature, we've added a little question mark, as shown below.

Clicking on a link will send you to the right place in the documentation.

For advanced users, this might not be an option that you will use. This is why we've included the possibility to hide completely the help link in the user interface.

## Language

Monica is translated into different languages. You can change the language whenever you want, and the change will be effective immediately.

:::info

Sometimes you will notice that some words in the application are not translated to your language.
For instance, if you create your account in the English language, Monica will populate the account with default parameters, like the names of tabs that appear on a contact sheet for instance.

Because everything is customizable and you can rename these names, we can't translate them for you with the new language, unfortunately. You will have to change the translations yourself in your account preferences.

## Timezone

Not everyone lives in the UTC timezone. Monica's users come from all over the world. Therefore, we need to let users manage their timezones. By default, UTC is the timezone for all users.

Changing timezone will affect all the dates that are displayed in the application, and will dictate at which time of the day we should send you the different reminders that you might define in your account.
